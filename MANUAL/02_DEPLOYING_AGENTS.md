# 📡 02. How to Connect Other Laptops (The Students)

**Computer:** On the 20 Lab Computers (or your friend's laptop).

## Step 1: Create the "Agent" File (On YOUR Laptop) before you go to the lab.
Since every WiFi/Lan is different, you need to tell the software "Where are you?".

1.  Connect YOUR laptop to the Network (Same WiFi or LAN as the lab).
2.  Double-click **`build_lab_agent.bat`**.
3.  A black window will ask a question.
    - Type **`y`** and press **Enter**.
4.  Wait 10 seconds.
5.  It will say **"Build Complete!"**.

> **Outcome:** Inside the `dist` folder, there is now a new file called **`agent.exe`**.

## Step 2: Copy to Student Laptops (The USB Stick Part)

3.  Go to **Student Laptop #1**.
4.  Plug in the USB.
5.  Copy `agent.exe` to their Desktop.
